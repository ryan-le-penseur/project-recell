## 🧠 Project Overview

This project tackles a real-world business or operational problem (ReCell) using supervised learning techniques. The goal is to build interpretable, high-performing models that predict outcomes using structured tabular data.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- ✅ Data loading & preprocessing
- 📈 Model building using Scikit-learn
- 🔍 Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC/AUC, etc.)
- 🧪 Hyperparameter tuning
- 🧠 Interpretation of model results

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn 1.2.2
- Seaborn 0.13.1
- Matplotlib 3.7.1

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using **Google Colab**, uncomment the following cell in the notebook:

```python
!pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2 seaborn==0.13.1 matplotlib==3.7.1 numpy==1.25.2 pandas==1.5.3 -q --user
```

---

## 📓 Running the Notebook

Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Google Colab and run the cells sequentially:

```bash
jupyter notebook SLF_Project_LearnerNotebook.ipynb
```

---

## 📈 Example Output

- Model accuracy & classification metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization
- ROC curve analysis
- Feature importance breakdown (if applicable)
